The definition of $\sqrt{2}$ is that 
\[\sqrt{2}^2=2.\]

If $\sqrt{2}$ was rational there must be a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are positive Integers and they have no equal divider, so that 
\[\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2=2.\]
so
\[\frac{p^2}{q^2}=2\]


Wen we multiply by $q^2$ we get
\[p^2=2q^2\]

So $p^2$ is an even number and thus $p$ is also even.

let $a$ be $\frac{p}{2}$ so
\[4a^2=2q^2\]
and
\[2a^2=q^2\]

So $q^2$ is an even number and thus $q$ is also even.

What we see here is, that both $p$ and $q$ are even, but our assumption is, that they have no equal divider.
Therefore our assumpton is wrong and 
\[\sqrt{2}\notin \mathbb{Q} \]
